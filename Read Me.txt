#Credit Card SQL Capstone Project

This SQL project focuses on the credit card department of a bank
that heavily relies on data science for acquiring new credit card customers.
The primary objective is to design and optimize a data-driven Credit Scoring system, 
known as the application scorecard, to evaluate applicants' creditworthiness accurately. 
The system aids in setting cutoff values for credit card applications,
thereby assessing the level of risk associated with each applicant.
